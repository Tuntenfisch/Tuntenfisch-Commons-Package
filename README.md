# Tuntenfisch Commons Package

**Note:** This package is mainly intended to share assets across my personal Unity projects and might therefore change rather rapidly from version to version.

## Installation

**Important:** To install this package you will need a Unity version which supports adding a git package that resides in a repository sub-folder, e.g. Unity version >= 2019.3.4f1.

You can install this package inside your Unity project by following the steps below:

1. Open the Package Manager in Unity
2. Add a new package using the "Add package from git URL..." option
3. Paste in ```https://github.com/Tuntenfisch/Tuntenfisch-Commons-Package.git?path=Assets/Package/Tuntenfisch/Commons``` for the URL

**Note:** If you want to specify a package version you can append ```#*.*.*``` specifying your desired version to the URL before pasting it.
